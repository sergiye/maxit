Maxit - simple numbers game (for windows)

# How to play
- What is maxit app? MaxIt! is a remake of an old video game from the early 1980s. It is played on a 8x8 tile board with positive numbers in blue and negative numbers in red. One player can only select numbers in the current row and the other player in the current column.

- A selected number is removed from the board and its value is added to the score of the player. The selected number also sets the next row or column. After all numbers have been selected or no more moves are possible, the player with the highest score wins.

- MaxIt can be played by two players against each other or by one player against a smart algorithm. The levels range from 1 (=easy) to 5 (=hard). In single player mode, the algorithm gets stronger with each level, making it harder for the player to win. Additionally the numbers fade away after a while. In level 5 there are only a couple of seconds before only the current row or column is visible. So you'd better be quick!
